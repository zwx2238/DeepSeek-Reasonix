// ways. The signature detector keys on each call's (tool, error/blocker) — not
// its args — since a stuck model reworks the arguments cosmetically while
// hitting the same host refusal or failure (see the stormSig field doc). The
// streak detector counts consecutive turns in which every call was blocked,
// regardless of shape: rotating tools, reordering a batch, or a blocker whose
// text varies per attempt escapes the signature but is still zero progress —
// only a host refusal (not a plain error) proves that, so the streak requires
// blocked outcomes. Any success resets both. When a guard fires — or when a
// call in the batch was already blocked by the per-call repeat-success guard —
// the final-readiness loop-guard pass is armed so the model may report the
// blocker (see loopGuardAllowsFinal). The hard maxSteps guard remains the
// ultimate backstop; this just keeps the loop from burning that whole budget
// bouncing off the same host refusals.
