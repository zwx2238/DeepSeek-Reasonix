# Reasonix WebView2 compatibility patch

This directory is rebased on Wails WebView2 v1.0.28, upstream commit
`5539733d1b61b7584f9665d72f0256ffd52096ff`, from the `webview2/` module in
`github.com/wailsapp/wails`. The upstream MIT license is retained in `LICENSE`.

Wails v2.13 still imports `github.com/wailsapp/go-webview2/pkg/edge`, while
v1.0.28 moved to `github.com/wailsapp/wails/webview2`. The vendored module and
its self-imports therefore keep the legacy module path as a compatibility
adapter; all other upstream v1.0.28 files are copied without API redesign.

The v1.0.28 upstream implementation owns monitor-scale detection. Reasonix does
not call `PutRasterizationScale` or maintain a DPI scaling fork.

Reasonix carries only these behavioural additions in `pkg/edge`:

- process-failure diagnostics, including reason, exit code and source module;
- one native renderer `Reload`, bound to its exact navigation ID;
- recovery observer events consumed by the desktop restart coordinator;
- `--no-proxy-server` for the embedded/loopback UI (network clients remain in
  the Go host).

The `reasonix_transcript_smoke` test build also exposes asynchronous
`CapturePreview` polling and the selected runtime version to the independent
Win11 compositor regression host. Those symbols are excluded from production
builds and do not instrument the Wails application or frontend bridge.

Obsolete pre-native-loader DLLs from v1.0.23 were removed. Update this file,
the upstream commit, and the Windows cross-compile test together on each rebase.
