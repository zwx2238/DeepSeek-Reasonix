// Regression for #6429 (also #5561/#5481): switching to a session whose plan
// approval / ask is pending flashed the prompt and then lost it. The backend
// replays the prompt event when the detached runtime re-attaches, but a
// runtime snapshot fetched BEFORE that event (pre-attach ListTabs, activation
// metas) could be dispatched AFTER it — reporting the tab idle, clearing the
// prompt, and skipping the compensating replay because its pendingPrompt was
// false. Snapshots that predate the live prompt event must be ignored.
