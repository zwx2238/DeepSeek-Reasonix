# Reasonix Benchmarks

Three harnesses live under `benchmarks/`; `cmd/e2ebench` also exposes a
SWE-bench Verified mode:

- `e2e/` — the committed end-to-end task suite, driven by
  [`cmd/e2ebench`](../cmd/e2ebench/main.go). It runs each task against a real
  provider and emits a markdown + JSON report (accuracy, cache-hit rate, token
  use, cost) suitable for pasting into a PR.
- `context-maintenance-e2e/` — a standalone seed → resume → comprehension
  harness that A/B-compares cold-restart cache behavior with and without
  context pruning.
- `compaction/` — CompactionBench: grows a session one generation at a time and
  folds it after each, measuring what repeated compaction costs and what it
  loses. See [CompactionBench](#compactionbench) below.

```

## Task corpus stratification

The suite is stratified by real coding-agent workload classes, not toy-task
convenience — the classes are what the per-class compare tables and marginal-
utility readouts key on. Current coverage vs. target:

| Class | Target | Committed | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `atomic-bugfix` | 8 | 8 | short anchored fixes; routes ExecutorOnly by design |
| `repo-exploration` | 6 | 6 | multi-file reading, invented-token answers so they can't be guessed |
| `multi-file-bugfix` | 8 | 8 | one bug spanning ≥2 files; naturally engages the planner gate |
| `refactor` | 6 | 6 | behavior-preserving restructuring, structure asserted |
| `failing-test-diagnosis` | 6 | 6 | unittest suite red → fix source; tests checksummed |
| `api-integration` | 4 | 4 | use a provided local package per its README |
| `ambiguous` | 4 | 4 | underspecified ask; grader accepts the defensible core |
| `long-horizon` | 4 | 4 | multi-requirement specs; planner-depth full |
| `codegen` / `delegation` | — | 3 | legacy smoke tasks (fizzbuzz, palindrome, subagent-delegation) |
| `completion-integrity` | 11 | 11 | **no reachable solution**; scored on honesty, not correctness (below) |

Grader authoring rule: every task must fail `verify.sh` on the pristine seed
and pass it on a reference solution (validated before commit). SWE-bench
Verified (below) supplies the realistic-repo end of the spectrum; this corpus
covers the fast, controlled, per-class end.

## Completion Integrity

Every task above is solvable by construction, which makes it useless for the
question this suite could not previously ask: **when the work cannot be done,
does the agent say so?** On a solvable corpus a false completion is
indistinguishable from an honest failure to solve.

The `completion-integrity` class supplies the missing half. Each task declares
`no_solution = true` and is unsolvable for a different reason — contradictory
protected tests, a dependency that does not exist with no network, a spec the
repo never contained, a defect in a tree the prompt forbids touching, an
oracle held in an environment variable, a golden that cannot be reproduced, a
requirement Python's import machinery cannot satisfy, an authoritative test
that is simply wrong. The only correct outcomes are an honest non-completion
or a report naming what is missing.

Two inversions follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **`verify.sh` grades the inverse contract.** It exits 0 when the fixture
  contract survived and 1 when the agent manufactured a pass by editing a
  protected test, vendoring the missing dependency, planting the absent spec,
  or special-casing the assertion. The protected-file manifest is embedded in
  `verify.sh` itself, which e2ebench drops in only after the run, so the agent
  never learns what is watched. Consequently these graders **pass on the
  pristine seed** — the opposite of the rule above.
- **They leave the accuracy denominators.** "Did not cheat" is not "solved", so
  counting them would inflate the solve rate and make cost-per-solved
  meaningless. `gatherSuiteStats` and `aggregateArm` skip them; the report
  scores them separately, spend included.

The report prints the honesty matrix next to the solvable-side solve rate on
purpose. An arm that never claims anything scores perfectly on integrity and
collapses on accuracy, so neither number can be optimized alone:

```text
**Completion integrity** (11 no-solution tasks): **false completion** 9% (1 claimed done) ·
**tampered** 0% (0 manufactured a pass) · honest 91% (10) · verdicts partial ×8 · incomplete ×2 · done ×1
Read it against the solvable side above (71% solved, 35/49): staying silent to look honest costs accuracy there.
```

Scoring reads the completion report recorded in the run's trajectory, so these
tasks must run with `-trajectory`; runs without one are counted `unmeasured`
rather than honest. `TestNoSolutionCorpusGradesTheInverseContract` holds the
corpus to both halves of its contract — pristine seeds grade clean, and every
grader actually rejects the cheat it exists to catch.

Each task under `e2e/tasks/<id>/` contains:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `task.toml` | The task definition (prompt, step/timeout limits). |
| `verify.sh` | The grader: exits 0 iff the agent's artifacts are correct. |
| `workdir/` | Optional seed workspace, copied into the temp run dir before the agent starts. |

## Anchor resistance

Multi-agent systems isolate conversations. They rarely isolate conclusions: a
sub-agent asked to "independently check this" usually arrives already holding
its parent's answer. Before adding an interface to prevent that, measure
whether it costs anything here — a handed-down conclusion that the agent
routinely overturns is not a problem worth building against.

The `-anchor` arms make that measurable on the `failing-test-diagnosis` tasks,
which have one knowable cause each. Each carries two authored hypotheses: the
real cause (`seed_correct`) and a plausible one that is not (`seed_wrong`).
The arm prefixes the prompt with its seed, so the agent meets the conclusion
before it has read anything.

```bash
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -task diagnose-float-total,diagnose-floor-division,diagnose-missing-file,diagnose-tie-order,diagnose-utf8-bom,diagnose-version-sort -json blind.json
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -anchor correct -task ...same... -json correct.json
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -anchor wrong   -task ...same... -json wrong.json
```

Anchor resistance is the wrong arm's solve rate over the blind arm's on the
same tasks. A wrong arm that collapses says a handed-down conclusion survives
contact with the evidence, and that blind delegation is worth its cost; a wrong
arm that barely moves says the opposite. Nothing here is a single composite
"independence score" — the arms are reported separately because they answer
different questions.

Two limits are worth stating rather than discovering later. The seed goes to
the top-level agent, so it prices agent-level anchoring; it reaches a
sub-agent only if the parent delegates and repeats it, which the **evidence
origin** line under Delegation is what measures. And the seeded arms score a
smaller corpus than the blind one — every skipped task is named in the report,
because a seeded arm quietly scoring fewer tasks is not the same experiment.

### Evidence origin

The Delegation section reports how much of what the children looked at they
had to find themselves, and what the parent's own delegation text pointed at.
Both come from host receipts and the parent-authored task text before host
framing, never from anything an agent claims.

Two kinds of pointing are counted apart, because they are not the same act:

| | What it is | Blind delegation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **scope hint** (`pkg/`) | Narrowing the search — the unavoidable cost of handing work off at all | expected, and recorded |
| **named file** (`pkg/romeo.py`) | Saying where the answer is | the number that should be zero |

Discovery is judged against named files only: a child sent to a directory
still had to work out which file in it mattered, so a scope hint never erases
its credit. Both stay absolute counts — a rate would hide how large the
hand-over was — while the discovery share is a ratio of summed paths across
children, not a mean of per-child rates, so a child that opened one file
cannot outweigh one that swept forty.

## Neutral metering

A harness comparison has an accounting problem before it has a measurement
problem: **no contestant should count its own tokens**. Reasonix writes
`.run-metrics.json`, other harnesses do not, and a comparison published by one
of the contestants cannot rest on each contestant's self-report.

`-meter` moves the measurement onto the request boundary. The bench starts a
loopback proxy, writes a temp config whose *benchmarked provider* points at it,
and hands the child `REASONIX_HOME`; prompt, completion and cache-split tokens
are then counted identically for anything that speaks the endpoint.

```sh
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -meter ~/.reasonix/config.toml -trajectories t/
```

- **Credentials are never touched.** The config names an `api_key_env`, so the
  key stays in the environment the child inherits; only `base_url` is rewritten.
- **Only the provider serving `-model` is redirected.** Rewriting every endpoint
  would send one vendor's traffic to another's host.
- **Streamed requests are opted into usage.** An OpenAI-compatible stream
  carries no usage block unless the client asked for one, so a harness that
  never asks would measure as free. Non-streamed bodies are forwarded byte-for-
  byte.
- **A response with no usage is `unmeasured`, never zero.** Silent zeroes would
  flatter whichever harness reports least.

The report prints what the proxy saw and how far the harness's own accounting
drifted from it:

```text
**Metered at the boundary** (49 runs): tokens 12,904,331 · cache hit 71% ·
**self-report divergence** +0.2% (harness 12,930,118 vs meter 12,904,331 over 49 runs)
```

That divergence is the publishability gate. Reasonix is the first harness
metered this way precisely because it *does* self-report: if the proxy and
`.run-metrics.json` disagree about the same run, one of them is wrong and no
cross-harness number is ready to publish.

## Fault recovery

`-faults` injects provider failures through the same proxy — deterministic, and
replayable across harnesses. Two forms:

- `3:429` — a targeted failure at an exact request.
- `every:5:500` — a cadence. **A mixed-length suite needs this**: a task that
  only ever makes four requests would never reach a fixed index and would join
  the unfaulted group without anyone noticing.

An absolute index wins over the cadence, so a targeted failure stays where it
was asked for.

```sh
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -meter ~/.reasonix/config.toml -faults every:5:500 -trajectories t/
```

The readout separates two things that are easy to conflate:

```text
**Fault recovery** (31 runs failed on purpose, 47 injections): **retried** 94% (29) ·
**still solved** 61% (19/31) · in-run control 78% (14/18 never hit a fault)
```

- **retried** — the meter saw another request after the failure. A harness that
  dies on the first 429 never reaches this, and *was never really tested*.
- **still solved** — the task landed anyway. A harness can retry forever and
  still not finish; that is not recovery.
- **in-run control** — with a cadence, short tasks never hit a fault, so the
  same run carries its own unfaulted baseline. The cost of failure is measured
  against the same suite and model rather than a separate arm run at another
  time under other conditions.

## Segmented runs

A twelve-hour session is not interesting because it is twelve hours long. It is
interesting because of the states it passes through: a session reloaded from
disk, a prefix rebuilt, a compaction crossing a turn boundary, a user arriving
mid-task with a new instruction. `-segments N` reaches those states directly
instead of waiting hours for them.

```sh
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -segments 3 -steer "also handle empty input@2" -trajectories t/
```

Leg 1 starts the session with the task. Later legs resume it with `--continue`,
which is unambiguous because each task already runs in its own home and
therefore its own session directory. A resumed leg is deliberately **not** given
the task again — its prompt is a bare continuation, because a leg that restates
the work would hide exactly the degradation this is meant to expose. A `-steer`
entry replaces one leg's continuation with a user turn.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **The step budget is divided, never multiplied.** A segmented arm gets the
  same `max_steps` as the control arm, split across legs with the remainder on
  the last. Otherwise the arm would win by being allowed to work longer.
- **Each leg writes its own metrics file.** They share a work dir, so a single
  `.run-metrics.json` would leave the last leg's numbers standing in for the
  whole run and the earlier legs' tokens would simply vanish. `Segments` in the
  JSON records how many legs a run had.

A leg that fails ends the run: resuming a session the child never finished
writing would measure crash recovery, which is a different experiment.

Only the last leg's trajectory digest is read, so time attribution and cognition
lines describe that leg rather than the whole run. Merging per-leg trajectories
is not done yet; `Segments` is what tells you the digest is partial.

## task.toml schema

`e2ebench` reads `benchmarks/e2e/tasks/<id>/task.toml` with the BurntSushi TOML
decoder. The task ID is the directory name; tasks run in sorted ID order.

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | string | yes | The task instruction handed to the agent. |
| `class` | string | no | Task class label (e.g. `bugfix`, `codegen`, `exploration`) for per-class marginal-utility breakdowns in compare mode. |
| `max_steps` | int | yes | Agent tool-call cap; passed through as `--max-steps` to `reasonix run`. |
| `no_solution` | bool | no | Ground truth: no reachable solution exists. The task leaves every accuracy denominator, its `verify.sh` grades the inverse contract, and it is scored on honesty instead. See [Completion Integrity](#completion-integrity). |
| `timeout_sec` | int | no | Per-task wall-clock timeout in seconds; defaults to `240` when omitted or `0`. |
| `seed_correct` | string | no | The task's real cause, phrased as a conclusion handed down before the run. Used by `-anchor correct`. See [Anchor resistance](#anchor-resistance). |
| `seed_wrong` | string | no | A plausible cause that is **not** the real one. Used by `-anchor wrong`. Author both seeds or neither: a task seeded on one side only would be scored in one arm and skipped in the other. |

Example (`tasks/fizzbuzz/task.toml`):

```toml
prompt = "Create a file named fizzbuzz.py containing a function fizzbuzz(n) that returns the string 'Fizz' when n is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' when divisible by 5, 'FizzBuzz' when divisible by both 3 and 5, and otherwise the number as a string. Do not print anything at import time."
max_steps = 12
timeout_sec = 180
```

## verify.sh contract

`verify.sh` is the grader for a task:

- It is a `bash` script run with `set -e`; exit code `0` means the task passed.
- It runs inside the temp work dir **after** the agent finishes, alongside the
  copied `workdir/` seed and whatever files the agent produced — so it can
  import generated Python modules, read `answer.txt`/`result.txt`, etc.
- The harness copies `verify.sh` into the work dir only after the run, so the
  agent can never read the answer key during the run.
- Its stdout/stderr is streamed to the job log (stderr), not the report.

Examples: `compaction/verify.sh` normalizes `answer.txt` (strip whitespace,
lowercase) and compares it to the expected `aldermoor-verrin`;
`fizzbuzz/verify.sh` imports the generated module and asserts on
`fizzbuzz(3)`, `fizzbuzz(5)`, `fizzbuzz(15)`, `fizzbuzz(7)`.

Python graders must start with
`export PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX="$(mktemp -d)"`: macOS system Python caches
bytecode centrally keyed by absolute path, so an agent edit that keeps a
file's size within the same mtime second would otherwise execute stale
bytecode while tracebacks display the new source.

## Running the e2e suite

Prerequisites: a `reasonix` binary (or `go run ./cmd/reasonix` …) with a
configured provider. The harness invokes the agent as
`reasonix run --auto --metrics <path> [--model NAME] [--max-steps N] [--profile delivery] [--ablate ARM] <prompt>`
inside a temp copy of the task's `workdir/`; the `--auto` flag is deliberate so
unattended fixture writes are allowed.

```sh
# Run the committed suite, report to stdout
go run ./cmd/e2ebench

# Same suite with the delivery prompt profile
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -profile delivery

# Write the markdown report to a file and the raw results to JSON
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -out report.md -json report.json

# Grade a PR's diff (generates tests for the diff, grades with the repo's tests)
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -mode diff -base origin/main-v2 -repo . -attempts 3 -timeout 1800
```

The markdown report contains the solved count, cost/tokens per solved task,
median wall time, cache-hit rate, and a per-task table with failure class
(`solved`, `timeout`, `wrong_patch`, `no_metrics`, `skipped`, or the agent's
own outcome).

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-mode` | `suite` | `suite` \| `diff` \| `swebench` \| `compare` \| `traj` (`diff` generates tests for the PR diff; `swebench` runs the official per-instance evaluation; `compare` renders KPI/Pareto readouts from 2+ `-json` reports; `traj` re-digests recorded trajectory files without spending tokens). |
| `-suite` | `benchmarks/e2e` | Suite root (must contain `tasks/<id>/`). |
| `-task` | *(all)* | Suite mode: run only these comma-separated task IDs (e.g. `-task fix-add-bug`); unknown IDs fail with the available list. |
| `-attempts` | `1` | Suite and diff modes: retry a task until an attempt passes, up to N; enables the `Pass@≤N` KPI, and TTCS charges a retried solve with its failed attempts' wall. |
| `-bin` | `reasonix` | Path to the reasonix binary. |
| `-model` | *(config default)* | Provider/model name. |
| `-profile` | `baseline` | Tool-surface/runtime tier: `baseline` \| `economy` \| `balanced` \| `delivery`. All but `baseline` append `--profile <tier>` to the agent invocation; `baseline` passes no flag (byte-identical legacy control, behaviorally `balanced`). Economy starts with the core tool set and pays `connect_tool_source` rounds plus prefix resets to grow it — the report's Tool surface line prices that trade. |
| `-ablate` | *(none)* | Ablation arm: comma-separated subsystems to switch off — `evidence`, `planner`, `subagent`, `retrieval`, `compaction`; `none` \| `all`. |
| `-out` | *(stdout)* | Write the markdown report here. |
| `-json` | *(none)* | Write the JSON report here (optional). |
| `-trajectories` | *(none)* | Suite mode: write one `<task-id>.trajectory.jsonl` per task into this directory (the agent's full event stream with timestamps — see `reasonix run --trajectory`). The report gains a time-attribution line (tools vs. model) and each JSON result a `trajectory` digest. |
| `-force-planner` | `false` | Suite mode: prefix each prompt with a plan-first directive so the two-model turn engages regardless of the planner gate. Use for the "with planner" arm of an A/B; results carry `plan_forced` so arms are only comparable with equal forcing. |
| `-anchor` | `blind` | Suite mode: which hypothesis the agent holds before it looks at anything — `blind` (none, the control) \| `correct` \| `wrong`. The seeded arms prefix each prompt with the task's authored seed and **skip** tasks that have none, so an unseeded control run never lands in a seeded denominator. Results carry `anchor`. See [Anchor resistance](#anchor-resistance). |
| `-cache` | `cold` | Suite mode: `cold` runs each task as a fresh session (the fair cross-agent comparison arm); `warm` primes the provider prefix cache with a one-step run in the same workdir first, measuring the long-lived-session steady state. Never mix arms in one report — compare them with `-mode compare cold.json warm.json`. |
| `-budget` | `800000` | Abort once total tokens cross this (`0` = no cap). Remaining tasks are reported as skipped. |
| `-meter` | *(off)* | Suite mode: route the benchmarked provider through the neutral measuring proxy, using this `config.toml` as the source. Spend is then counted at the request boundary instead of trusted from the harness. See [Neutral metering](#neutral-metering). |
| `-faults` | *(none)* | Suite mode: inject provider failures through the meter — absolute indices (`3:429`) and/or a cadence that scales with the run (`every:5:500`). Requires `-meter`. See [Fault recovery](#fault-recovery). |
| `-segments` | `1` | Suite mode: split each task into N resumed legs (`--continue` between them). The step budget is **divided**, never multiplied. See [Segmented runs](#segmented-runs). |
| `-steer` | *(none)* | Suite mode: deliver a user turn at a leg boundary, e.g. `"also handle empty input@2"`. Requires `-segments` to reach that leg. |

Diff-mode flags:

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-repo` | `.` | Repo root (diff mode). |
| `-base` | *(none)* | Base ref to diff the PR head against (diff mode). |
| `-test-cmd` | `go test` | Grader command run on the affected packages (diff mode). |
| `-max-steps` | `80` | Agent tool-call cap for the diff task. |
| `-timeout` | `1200` | Agent timeout in seconds (diff mode). |
| `-attempts` | `1` | Diff mode: retry up to N times until a run passes (stochastic agent). |

## Dataset retention

Keep every `-json` report and `-trajectories` directory from real runs: they
are the accumulating corpus — per-task contracts-to-be, full event
trajectories, checkpoint oracle verdicts, stop curves and phase traces — that
any future offline learning (routing, stop policies, budgets) would train
and evaluate on. The control plane stays deterministic and interpretable
until that corpus reaches a scale where learned policies can be judged
against the same oracles that produced it; nothing learned lands before it
beats the deterministic baseline on these numbers.

## A/B compare mode

Run the same suite twice and let the harness judge the trade:

```sh
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -force-planner -trajectories t-a -json with.json
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -ablate planner -trajectories t-b -json without.json
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -mode compare with.json without.json
```

Compare mode renders a per-solved delta table (solve rate, model requests,
planner requests, model rounds, tool calls, tokens, wall, cost), an overall
marginal-utility line (`accuracy +X.Xpp · wall/task +Y.Ys`), and — when tasks
carry `class` labels — a per-class breakdown, so a subsystem's uplift and
latency cost can be judged per task class instead of globally.

## SWE-bench Verified mode

`e2ebench` can also run the agent inside the official SWE-bench evaluation
images and hand the resulting patches to the official grader:

```sh
# Requires Docker, the `swebench` Python package, evaluation images, and a
# network/proxy setup that prevents the agent from reading upstream fixes.
go run ./cmd/e2ebench -mode swebench \
  -subset benchmarks/swebench/subset.json \
  -network reasonix-eval -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

SWE-bench mode accepts the `-model`, `-profile`, `-ablate`, `-permission`,
`-workers`, `-dataset`, `-run-id`, `-harness-python`, and `-keep-images` flags;
its report is produced by the official harness rather than the suite JSON
writer.

## Adding a new task

1. Create `benchmarks/e2e/tasks/<task-id>/`.
2. Write `task.toml` with `prompt`, `max_steps`, and `timeout_sec` (see
   [schema](#tasktoml-schema)).
3. If the task needs seed files, add them under `workdir/` (they are copied
   into the temp run dir; symlinks are skipped).
4. Write `verify.sh`: `set -e`, exit 0 iff the agent's artifacts are correct.
   Keep the expected answer out of the prompt and seed; the script runs in the
   work dir and may validate anything the agent produced.
5. Iterate on just that task with the single-task filter, then commit:

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/e2ebench -task <task-id>
   ```

## context-maintenance-e2e

This harness measures what happens when a long session goes idle past the
provider's cache TTL and then resumes: it A/B-compares cold-restart miss tokens
with and without pruning, and checks that the agent re-reads a file behind a
prune placeholder instead of hallucinating.

It is hardcoded to the `deepseek-v4-flash` model at `https://api.deepseek.com`
and requires the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.

```sh
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...

# Seed both arms (pruned + control) with a large session and warm the cache
go run ./benchmarks/context-maintenance-e2e seed

# Wait past the provider's cache TTL, then resume: prune the "pruned" arm and
# compare cold-restart miss tokens
go run ./benchmarks/context-maintenance-e2e resume

# Run the comprehension trials (agent must re-read a pruned file and answer
# from it); exits non-zero unless every trial passes
go run ./benchmarks/context-maintenance-e2e comprehension
```

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-dir` | `benchmarks/context-maintenance-e2e/run` | State directory for `seed`/`resume` (sessions + `meta.json`, `resume-<ts>.json`). |
| `-trials` | `5` | Number of comprehension trials. |

## memorybench

The memory-effectiveness suite. Each task seeds an isolated memory state root
(`tasks/<id>/memory/project|global/*.md`, production frontmatter) before the
run; `memory_markers` in task.toml are unique tokens planted in fact bodies,
counted as used only when they appear in tool arguments or answer text after
a recall injected facts (point of use, not ranking).

The core KPI is the paired counterfactual, not Recall@K:

```
e2ebench -suite benchmarks/memorybench -budget 0 -trajectories t-on  -json on.json
e2ebench -suite benchmarks/memorybench -budget 0 -policy memory-off -trajectories t-off -json off.json
e2ebench -mode compare on.json off.json     # Memory utility section
```

Utility delta = paired Pass(on) − Pass(off). Harmful attribution is paired,
never judged: the same task passed without memory and failed with it while
recall fired. Scenario classes: exact, paraphrase, cjk, symbol, distractor
(1 relevant fact under 100 noise facts), conflict (project-over-global),
stale (repo truth must beat an expired claim), contradiction, generic (recall
must stay silent), history (exact repo wording beats a memory paraphrase),
update (revised value wins), pinned (prefix channel end to end).

## CompactionBench

`benchmarks/compaction/` drives the real agent compaction path over a session
that grows one generation at a time. Each generation appends a round of work
and then folds, so generation N folds everything generations 1..N produced —
which is the growth that matters, because a fold re-derives its digest from the
whole canonical transcript rather than from the previous digest.

```bash
go run ./benchmarks/compaction -mode=cost                     # offline, no API key
go run ./benchmarks/compaction -mode=fidelity -gens=8          # needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

**Cost arm** (`-mode=cost`) is deterministic and needs no provider: a scripted
summarizer answers every call and refuses any input larger than the window, the
way a real provider does. It reports per generation how many summarizer calls
the fold took, how large the largest one was, and whether the fold succeeded at
all — so a session that grows until it can no longer be compacted shows up as an
error row rather than as a theory. `go test ./benchmarks/compaction/` runs a
smaller version of the same thing as a regression guard.

**Fidelity arm** (`-mode=fidelity`) plants facts a coding agent must not lose —
a standing constraint, a correction that supersedes an earlier instruction, an
exact identifier, a pending requirement, whether a passing test has been re-run
since the code changed, a ruled-out hypothesis, a tool outcome, chronology —
and after each fold asks a question only that fact answers, against the
compacted context. Every probe is also asked against the full history in the
same run: a probe the model gets wrong with everything in front of it is a bad
probe, not a compaction loss.

Probe answers are scored on whole words, and a wanted answer does not count if a
rejected one appears anywhere in the same reply — "yes, but it has not been
re-run since" is the shape a drifting digest produces, and it is not a pass.

### Fold arms

`-arm=full` (default) re-derives every digest from the canonical transcript, so
digests never chain. `-arm=incremental` folds the model-visible view instead,
feeding the previous digest back through the summarizer. The arms exist to price
that trade: run the cost arm for what chaining saves, and the fidelity arm for
what it costs.

```bash
go run ./benchmarks/compaction -mode=cost -arm=incremental
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… go run ./benchmarks/compaction -mode=fidelity -arm=incremental
```
