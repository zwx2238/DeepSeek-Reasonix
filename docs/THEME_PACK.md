# Reasonix Theme Pack V2

Native theme packs for the Reasonix desktop app. Packs are controlled skins:
semantic color tokens, density/corner recipes, and optional local images for
the home and task/workspace scenes. They **cannot** run CSS, JavaScript, fonts,
remote URLs, or SVG scripts. V1 packs remain valid and use the home image in
both scenes.

> Chinese: [THEME_PACK.zh-CN.md](./THEME_PACK.zh-CN.md)

## Goals (first release)

- Built-in styles, user themes, backgrounds, live preview, import/export, local library
- Full background on the home (empty) scene; reduced opacity + directional overlay on task scenes
- Works with Classic / Workbench / Creation and `auto` / `light` / `dark`
- **No** online marketplace, cloud sync, or script plugins

## Theme experience (settings IA)

Appearance is split into two surfaces (no third entry):

1. **Appearance overview** — current theme summary, light/dark mode, **one** base-style
   control, fonts and zoom. Primary action: **Browse themes**.
2. **Theme gallery** — official / my themes / base styles tabs, select-to-inspect cards,
   detail panel with isolated preview, temporary full-app preview, and a single
   **Apply theme** action. Immersive preview is part of the gallery detail flow.

State model (schema v2 of `desktop-theme-state.json`):

| State | Meaning | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `themeMode` | auto / light / dark | desktop config |
| `baseStyle` | Graphite…Amber | desktop config (`theme_style`) |
| `activeThemeId` | official, user or plugin pack only | `desktop-theme-state.json` |
| `selectedThemeId` / `previewThemeId` | gallery selection / temp preview | frontend memory only |

- `activeThemeId` **must not** store base style ids. Choosing a base style clears the pack.
- Applying a pack keeps `baseStyle` as the disable/fallback value.
- Light/dark mode is independent of the pack.

## Theme kinds

The gallery has four groups:

| Kind | Source | Editable | Deletable | Exportable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base styles** | Six visual directions (Graphite, Aurora, Slate, Carbon, Nocturne, Amber), token-less | no (duplicate first) | no | no |
| **Official themes** | Eight read-only packs embedded in the installer (manifest + original background + thumbnail, MIT) | no (duplicate first) | no | no |
| **User themes** | Created in the editor, duplicated, or imported as `.reasonix-theme` | yes | yes | yes |
| **Plugin themes** | `.reasonix-theme` packs contributed by enabled plugins (Manifest v2 `contributes.themes`), read straight from the plugin root — never copied into the user library | no | no (disable/uninstall the plugin) | no |

- All 14 built-in ids (6 base + 8 official) are **reserved**: save, import, copy-over
  and delete all refuse collisions.
- Activating an official theme stores only its id in `desktop-theme-state.json` —
  assets are read from the embedded copy at runtime.
- "Duplicate" on a base/official theme creates an ordinary editable user theme
  (the official background is copied into the user library); the duplicate can
  then be edited or exported.
- v1 states that stored a base id as `activeThemeId` are migrated to `desktop.theme_style`
  and cleared on load.
- Plugin theme ids are external names of the form `plugin:<plugin>:<theme>`; the
  pack's own `id` keeps following the usual id rules. Invalid contributed files
  are skipped with a warning in the theme views, never fatal. When the plugin
  behind the active id is missing, disabled or uninstalled, rendering falls back
  to the configured base style but the id is **preserved** in
  `desktop-theme-state.json` — reinstalling the same plugin restores the theme.
  Save/delete/duplicate/export reject plugin theme ids as read-only.

### The eight official themes

| `official-rose-dawn` | Rose Dawn / 玫瑰晨光 | graphite | Ivory dawn, soft roses, original illustrated muse |
| `official-fortune-forge` | Fortune Forge / 鸿运工坊 | amber | Vermilion/gold/jade workshop, original lucky programmer |
| `official-crimson-horizon` | Crimson Horizon / 赤曜新城 | graphite | Coral-red future city skyline, no people |

Previews are shown inside the app's theme library (Settings → Appearance) from
real Reasonix builds. **Screenshots of the app must not be imported as theme
backgrounds.** Asset provenance, hashes and licence ledger:
[THEME_ASSETS.md](./THEME_ASSETS.md) · generator scripts in
`scripts/official-theme-art/` (procedural, fixed seeds, reproducible).

### Fields

| Field | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | `1` or `2`; `taskBackground` requires `2` |
| `id` | Lowercase `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`, reserved: `graphite`, `aurora`, `slate`, `carbon`, `nocturne`, `amber` |
| `baseStyle` | One of the six built-in directions; uncovered tokens inherit it |
| `tokens.light` / `tokens.dark` | Optional maps of semantic keys → `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` only |
| `recipes.density` | `compact` \| `comfortable` |
| `recipes.corners` | `square` \| `soft` \| `round` |
| `background.image` | Bare file name only (png/jpeg/webp) |
| `background.focusX/Y` | 0–1 focal point |
| `background.safeArea` | `left` \| `right` \| `center` (task overlay direction) |
| `background.homeOpacity` | 0–1 |
| `background.taskOpacity` | 0–1 |
| `background.overlayStrength` | 0–1 |
| `background.paneOpacity` | 0–1 (home scene panel opacity) |
| `taskBackground.image` | Optional independent task/workspace image; bare local file name only |
| `taskBackground.focusX/Y` | 0–1 focal point |
| `taskBackground.safeArea` | `left` \| `right` \| `center` |
| `taskBackground.opacity` | 0–1 |
| `taskBackground.overlayStrength` | 0–1 |
| `taskBackground.paneOpacity` | 0–1 (task scene panel opacity) |

### Allowed token keys

`bg`, `bgSoft`, `bgElev`, `panel`, `sidebar`, `chat`, `workspace`, `workspaceFiles`,
`border`, `borderSoft`, `fg`, `fgDim`, `fgFaint`, `accent`, `accentFg`, `ok`, `warn`, `err`

Colors must **not** include `url()`, gradients, or arbitrary CSS.

## Engine behavior

1. Apply global `auto` / `light` / `dark` and the base visual style.
2. Apply the pack overlay (CSS custom properties) **after** stylesheets so it wins over trailing `:root` and Creation locals.
3. Root gets `data-theme-pack="<id>"`; the app container gets `data-theme-scene="home|task"`.
4. Scene is derived only from whether the current session has content — it does not change chat lifecycle.
5. Background is a fixed, non-interactive layer. Task scene dims the image and paints a directional wash (**no** `backdrop-filter`).

## Storage

| Path under Reasonix home | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `desktop-theme-state.json` | Versioned active theme pointer (not `config.toml`) |
| `themes/<id>/` | User theme library (`theme.json` + up to two optional scene images) |

Legacy installs without theme state keep the previous appearance. Old app versions ignore the new directory. CLI theme, prompts, provider requests, and cache keys are unchanged.

## Desktop bridge (frontend)

List / activate / reset / save / delete / copy / import / export / pick background.
The UI only receives temporary asset URLs (`/__reasonix_theme_asset/...`) or data URLs — never absolute host paths.

Import: same id is rejected until the user confirms atomic replace. Built-ins cannot be overwritten or deleted. Corrupt / missing packs fall back to the Graphite path. `/theme reset` and the command palette restore entry clear the pack.

## Authoring tips

1. Start from a built-in direction and override only the tokens you need.
2. Prefer WCAG AA contrast (≈ 4.5:1 body text). The editor warns but does not block save.
3. Before sharing a pack with a photo or portrait, confirm redistribution rights.
4. Do not ship third-party or copyrighted reference assets from other products.

## Template

    }
  },
  "recipes": {
    "density": "comfortable",
    "corners": "soft"
