# Session Catalog and Desktop Startup

Reasonix keeps session transcripts, event logs, metadata sidecars, and
`desktop-projects.json` as the only authoritative session data. The desktop
project tree reads a disposable SQLite projection from
`<cache root>/session-catalog/v6.sqlite`; deleting that database never deletes
or changes a conversation. The earlier `v1.sqlite` through `v5.sqlite` caches
are left in place so a concurrent or downgraded process cannot cross-write the
projection. v6 introduces filesystem-aware path identity and is rebuilt from
authoritative files on first use while the old v5 file remains available for
rollback. A manual rebuild of v6 also leaves a timestamped `.replaced-*` copy
of the previous index.

## Invariants

- Startup and project-tree requests never decode transcript JSONL, run legacy
  migration, or wait for a directory scan.
- A successfully saved transcript is committed before its catalog update. The
  save observer performs only lexical queue staging and returns without
  filesystem probes. Background workers resolve filesystem identity, SQLite
  uniqueness is the final deduplication boundary, and reconciliation repairs
  updates dropped under queue pressure.
- Original session and workspace-root spellings are retained for file access
  and display. Separate identity keys resolve aliases and fold case only where
  the governing filesystem directory is case-insensitive; case-distinct files
  and projects on case-sensitive volumes remain separate.
- Missing legacy counts are represented as `unknown`. The session is visible
  immediately, then a single repair worker decodes it in the background.
- A missing file is marked degraded on the first scan. It is removed from the
  projection only after a second scan and the missing-file grace period.
- Runtime state (`open`, `running`, and live status) comes only from in-memory
  controllers and overlays catalog results. It is never persisted to SQLite.
- Catalog, migration, plugin, and MCP work is cancellable and never participates
  in the desktop shutdown lock. Shutdown gives pending catalog writes at most
  250 ms.
- A ready directory is reused only when its authoritative session path set,
  scope/workspace assignment, topic projection, and recovery-derived fields
  match the current files. Equal row counts are not sufficient.

## Storage and migration

`internal/sessioncatalog` uses a version ledger in `schema_migrations`; database
existence is not a migration signal. Local cache files use WAL,
`synchronous=NORMAL`, and a short busy timeout. An unavailable or obviously
remote cache path falls back to an in-memory catalog so storage failures cannot
block the application.

At open, Reasonix runs an integrity check. A corrupt or unmigratable database is
renamed with a `.corrupt-<timestamp>` suffix and replaced. The replacement is
rebuilt from sidecars and transcripts in the background. The quarantine and
rebuild paths never remove authoritative files.

The catalog stores only query projections:

- directory signatures, scan generations, checkpoints, and errors;
- project ordering, title, color, pin state, and workspace-root identity key;
- topic ordering, aggregate counts, activity, recovery, health state, and
  workspace-root identity key; and
- session access path plus path, directory, and workspace-root identity keys,
  preview, counts, fingerprints, recovery, and health state.

Topic pages use a `(pinned, last_activity_at, topic_id)` keyset cursor. The
default page size is 50 and the maximum is 200. Directory reconciliation commits
at most 64 sidecars per batch and persists its checkpoint before yielding.

## Desktop API

- `GetProjectTreeSnapshot` returns project shells, catalog state, progress, and
  revision without opening a session or sidecar file.
- `ListProjectTopics` performs cursor-paged search and time filtering.
- `GetTopicSummary` resolves one topic for active-turn UI without rebuilding the
  tree.
- `GetSessionCatalogStatus` and `RebuildSessionCatalog` expose safe diagnostics
  and replacement.
- `project-tree:changed-v2` carries a monotonic revision, affected workspace
  roots, and reason. Clients ignore older revisions and refresh only expanded
  affected roots.

`ListProjectTree` remains as a compatibility wrapper over the catalog. It no
longer has a synchronous filesystem fallback.

## Operations

Inspect the catalog without creating or changing it:

```sh
reasonix sessions diagnose
reasonix sessions diagnose --json
```

Replace only the disposable projection and index all saved desktop projects:

```sh
reasonix sessions reindex
reasonix sessions reindex --json
```

Use repeated `--dir PATH` flags to rebuild from an explicit set of directories.
Explicit directories are treated as global scope. Reindexing never edits or
deletes transcript, event, metadata, recovery, archive, or project files; the
previous index is retained for rollback.

## Plugin isolation

Manifest validation and plugin handshakes are independent from catalog and
project-tree work. An incompatible plugin is reported as
`disabled_incompatible`; the core controller remains usable. A legacy manifest
under Reasonix's managed plugin directory is atomically upgraded with a backup.
Development directories, absolute external roots, and symlinked sources are
never rewritten automatically and include a manual migration hint instead.

## Release gates

Preview/canary promotion should track catalog repair backlog, rebuild failures,
page latency, queue pressure, and shutdown duration. Required checks include
legacy/ corrupt fixtures, deterministic lifecycle races, `go test -race`, the
React contract tests, and `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds for supported macOS, Windows,
and Linux architectures.
